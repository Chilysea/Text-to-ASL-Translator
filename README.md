# Text-to-ASL-Translator 🧏‍♂️🤟

Welcome to our CIS 519 Project!

The Text-to-ASL Translator is a machine learning-driven application that converts English text into American Sign Language (ASL) symbols. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and image processing to create a tool aimed at enhancing accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. The application generates ASL symbols for input text, visualizing them as images or videos to assist in communication.
